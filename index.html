<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Hey there, and welcome! Whether you're a curious beginner or a seasoned tech fan, you're in the right place to learn all about Operating Systems (OS)—the core software that powers your computer or device.</p>
<h2>What is an Operating System (OS)</h2></br>
       <p>An operating system is the software that manages your computer’s hardware and allows you to interact with it. Think of it as the middleman between you and the computer—it runs programs, handles files, connects to the internet, and more!</p>
<h2>Four of the Most Common Operating Systems:</h2></br>
       <ol>
              <li>Windows – Made by Microsoft, used in many home and office computers.</li>
              <li>Linux – Open-source and popular for servers, developers, and tech-savvy users.</li>
              <li>macOS – Built by Apple and used in Mac computers.</li>
              <li>Android – Mostly found in smartphones and tablets.</li>
       </ol> </br>
<h2>What is the difference between a proprietary and an open-source operating system? </h2>
       <p>A proprietary operating system is owned by a company, the source code is not shared with the public, and users are not allowed to modify it, while an open-source operating system is free to use, its code is available to everyone, and users can view, change, and distribute it.</p>
